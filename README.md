# Apillon Santa is coming to town

’Tis the season for the holiday giveaway — Apillon’s first big merch party will pay tribute to all the progress made on the Apillon platform so far. Let’s celebrate together, dressed in the exquisite Apillon merch.

Apillon changes the way developers think and build the decentralized future. With its Web3 development platform, Apillon makes the transition to Web3 within reach, be it for Web2 developers keen on some Web3 project making or Web3 devs who already know their way around the vast Polkadot universe.
